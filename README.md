## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**cagaoxisvideos/cagaoxisvideos** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently not learning anything
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about nothing
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: don't
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: what are these? wtf is this
- âš¡ Fun fact: saying something like fun fact in the begining of a text makes the person read the whole phrase, right? gotcha, bitch!

Yes, stop it now.
